# input
Simple, small, easy and zero dependency input function similar to the one in Python.


## Motivation
I wanted a simple way to accept user input from terminal, especially one closer to python or a library without too much dependencies.
and also learn how to build a library I could use when needed.
> also serves as a reminder/inspiration that I can build a library/tool.


## Installation

Install `input` with npm

```bash
npm i @sparrow/input
```


## Usage/Examples

```js
import input from "input"

const name = await input("What is your name? ") // joe

console.log(name) // -> joe
```
